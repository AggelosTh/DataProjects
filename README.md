# DataProjects
In this project we are given measurements about the temperature, the humidity, the power of the air-condition and the motion detection in a room. The goal is to use them in a useful way so that we can predict when the air condition is on and gather useful information as well. The measurement files contain a lot of missing values and most of them do not match chronically. So, we use a variety of techniques  such as interpolation and regression in order to estimate the missing values. After that we can implement machine learning techniques to decide whether the air-condition is on or off.
